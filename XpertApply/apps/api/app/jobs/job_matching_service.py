"""Explainable profile-to-job fit scoring.

Deterministic weighted scoring (no randomness):
    30% role/title alignment
    25% required-skills match
    15% experience/project relevance
    10% seniority/level match
    10% location/remote preference match
     5% education/certification alignment
     5% work-authorization / sponsorship compatibility

Output is a MatchResult with a 0-100 score, a label, short reasons, missing
skills, risk factors, a resume angle, and a confidence value. AI is optional and
only used to polish the textual explanation; the numeric score is always
deterministic so matching works without OpenAI.
