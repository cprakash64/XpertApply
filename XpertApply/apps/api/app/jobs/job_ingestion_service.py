"""Discovery orchestration: profile -> criteria -> fetch -> normalize -> match.

`discover_jobs` reads the logged-in user's profile, builds search criteria,
fetches from allowed public sources (concurrently, with per-source error
isolation so one bad source never fails the whole run), normalizes and
deduplicates, persists fresh jobs, and scores them against the profile.

Sources can be injected for testing; in production they come from the curated
`source_registry`.
