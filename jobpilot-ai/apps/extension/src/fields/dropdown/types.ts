/**
 * Dropdown adapter contract.
 *
 * Every dropdown — native select, ARIA combobox, React Select, Greenhouse's
 * custom control, a searchable combobox, a multi-select, or a radio group that
 * behaves like options — is driven through this one interface. Automatic fill
 * and the user's own choice in the XpertApply widget both go through it; there is
 * no separate simplified path.
 *
 * The cardinal rule: a click attempt is NEVER success. `select()` must be
 * followed by `verify()` reading real DOM state before anything is reported
 * filled.
