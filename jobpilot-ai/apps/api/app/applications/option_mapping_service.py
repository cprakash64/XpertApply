"""Map a candidate's CONFIRMED answer onto an employer dropdown's exact option
wording (section E, priority 5 — used only after exact and controlled-alias
matching have failed, and always before asking the user).

Two invariants are enforced here in code, never left to the model:

1. The model may only ever RETURN one of the option labels we supplied. Its
   output is validated against that exact set; anything else is discarded.
2. The model may never DECIDE a consequential answer. For sponsorship, work
   authorization, consent/policy acknowledgement, criminal history and every
   demographic/EEO category, a mapping is attempted only when the user has
   already supplied and confirmed the underlying answer — the model is then
   restricted to translating that answer into the employer's phrasing.

Anything the model cannot map becomes "ask the user", never a guess.
