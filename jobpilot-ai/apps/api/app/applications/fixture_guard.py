"""Production guard against known development/seed fixtures reaching a real
application package.

Root cause of the "demo@example.com filled into a real application" report:
there was never a code-level fallback that substitutes demo data when a real
value is missing (confirmed by inspection of answer_vault_service.py) — the
seeded ``scripts/seed_demo_data.py`` account is the ONLY user row in this
project's single shared database, and its profile's ``full_name`` was later
edited to a real name via the normal profile-edit flow while its email
(``demo@example.com``, not editable via any route) stayed the seeded value.

This module adds a narrow, explicit denylist check — not a broad heuristic —
so a *literal known dev fixture* can never prepare a real (production)
application. It intentionally does NOT reject "unusual-looking" emails in
general (e.g. a real user who happens to use an @example.com address in a
dev/staging environment): only the exact identities this repo's own seed
script creates.

Gated by ``app_env``: this only blocks in "production". In development (the
only environment this project currently runs), the seeded demo account
remains usable for manual testing, matching existing behavior — the guard is
a forward-looking safety rail for when a real production deployment exists,
not a retroactive lockout of the shared dev account.
