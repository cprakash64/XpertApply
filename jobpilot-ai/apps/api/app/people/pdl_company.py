"""Resolve a JobPilot company to a verified People Data Labs company identity.

Searching people by display name is the weakest possible company constraint: it
depends on the job feed and the provider spelling a company the same way. PDL
exposes a stable ``job_company_id`` on every person record, so resolving the
employer once and then searching by that id is both more precise and more
forgiving of naming differences.

Resolution order, strongest evidence first:

1. an already-cached verified PDL identity for this company,
2. Company Enrichment by verified website/domain,
3. Company Enrichment by canonical name plus domain agreement,
4. Company Enrichment by a known alias,
5. unresolved.

PDL's Company Enrichment API returns a ``likelihood`` between 1 and 10 and
answers 404 when nothing matches (https://docs.peopledatalabs.com/docs/reference-company-enrichment-api).
Anything below the configured likelihood, or any answer whose own name/website
disagrees with what we asked for, is rejected rather than guessed at: a wrong
company id returns confidently wrong people, which is worse than none.
