    ``relationship_signals_available=False`` means the user-relationship
    comparison did not run — because ``people_network_matching_enabled`` is off,
    or the user has no stored education/employment history. It does **not** mean
    the comparison ran and found nothing.

    That distinction is the whole reason this parameter exists. ``school`` (15)
    and ``employer`` (10) are 25 of the 100 points available to a
    ``potential_referrer``. Counting absent evidence as a zero silently lowered
    the achievable maximum to 75 while the acceptance threshold stayed at 60 —
    so a referral candidate had to reach **80% of what it could possibly score**,
    while recruiters and hiring managers (whose weights carry no relationship
    component) needed only 60%.

    Observed live on the Samsara run: PDL returned 8 referral candidates, all 8
    scored between 45.0 and 58.9 against a threshold of 60.0, and every one was
    rejected as ``below_relevance_threshold``. The section rendered empty, which
    read to the user as "this company has nobody worth contacting".

    So when the comparison did not run, its weights are excluded from the total
    and the remaining signals are rescaled over the mass that *was* reachable.
    A candidate is then judged on the evidence the system actually looked at.
