# IMPORTANT: middleware order. `add_middleware` makes the LAST-added middleware
# the OUTERMOST. We add the unhandled-error catcher FIRST and CORS LAST so CORS
# is outermost and wraps the catcher's 500 response.
#
# Why this matters: an unhandled exception in a route otherwise propagates out to
# Starlette's ServerErrorMiddleware, which sits OUTSIDE CORSMiddleware — so its
# 500 has no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. A cross-origin browser then
# blocks that response and the frontend `fetch` rejects with an opaque
# "Failed to fetch" instead of the real error. Catching the exception in an
# inner middleware turns it into a normal response that flows back out THROUGH
# CORSMiddleware, so the browser receives a readable, CORS-enabled JSON error.
