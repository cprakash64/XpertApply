# Schema migration is a RELEASE step, not a per-replica startup step.
#
# With N API replicas, startup migration means N concurrent `alembic upgrade
# head` runs racing on the same database. Alembic takes a lock so they do not
# corrupt each other, but the losers block on boot, and a migration failure
# surfaces as a crash-looping replica rather than a halted deployment.
#
# Local development keeps it on for convenience (compose sets it true). In
# production leave RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP unset/false and run
# `alembic upgrade head` as one explicit step before rolling the replicas —
# see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md.
