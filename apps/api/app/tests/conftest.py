    to have the local Redis container running: with Redis up, scoring work was
    handed to a broker that no worker drains during a test, and assertions about
    other users' scores failed; with Redis down, the same tests passed.

    is the one they mean. A test that specifically covers enqueueing should
    monkeypatch ``broker_reachable`` back to True itself.
