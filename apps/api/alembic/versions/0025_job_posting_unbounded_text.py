"""Hold complete externally sourced job text instead of guessing a maximum.

A Flexport posting whose location listed every office city exceeded
``VARCHAR(255)`` and made ``POST /jobs/discover`` fail the whole batch with
``StringDataRightTruncation``. Truncating would have silently corrupted the
source data, so the columns that hold externally supplied prose and URLs become
``TEXT`` and keep the complete value. A separate short ``location_display`` is
derived for cards.

Identifiers, controlled enums, and domains stay bounded on purpose.
